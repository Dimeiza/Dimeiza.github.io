# Introduction

The force of COVID-19 is extremely powerful, even in the company that was reluctant to remote work, movement of remote work is emrerging. 

So, I have worked from my home, and I hoped to contribute reserving of social distance for company and society. 

And recently, I have suffered from back pain.

I have a Aeron chair and usually used it.

But in this time, famous and excellent chair can't helped me to sit a long time.

I was lying down in acute period(2 or 3 days) and wait recover, but even after acute period, I couldn't sit because back pain.

# First, VR helped me

I communicated my boss and I continued my work I can.

And in this condition, I have to do most activity other than job by lying instead sitting. 

In this situation, a capability of this device is so excellent.

After COVID-19, Oculus Quest helping me very much. In acute period, I has been watching Youtube with Oculus Quest in the morning to evening.

# The game brings a idea to me

Meanwhile, I am addicted to a HIDEO KOJIMA GAME.

But low back pain don't allowed me to play it.

Then I noticed a fact during looking at the game controller.

Is it a wireless controller?

Perhaps, Following concept allow me to play game by lying down...?

And following video is result that I did it.

Response was so good, I could play this game as usual in this concept. I continued to play this game in several hours.

# Coding with Oculus Quest

And I remembered a uploaded video to youtube.

{{< youtube dPdeNMuvUnI >}}


In last yeer, I uploaded a video that coding demo with Oculus Quest, and I received a several question about it.

> Is it like coding with a huge screen? Was it comfortable? Iâ€™d like to hear your experience

And my answer is:

> 1.Headset is heavy and stuffy.
>
> During a short time, I don't mind this, but in long hours, It became an obstacle of concentrate.

> 2.Font size vs legibility.
>
> Legibility of codes through oculus depends a font size, and reading a code is harder than with desktop App directly.

But... In considering with experience of "Death Stranding with Oculus Quest", I thought that this problem is not an obstacle.

1. Headset is heavy and stuffy.
    * Using Oculus Quest with lying down, the weight of the headset is not directly on the head.
2. Font size vs legibility.
    * In "Death Stranding with Oculus Quest", I could read  message texts clearly.
    * Is it configuration problem? (screen contrast and screen size)

Therefore, If I have following environment, I may be able to work even if I lie down like a playing game?

* An environment with wireless input(mouse and keyboard)
* An environment I can operate mouse and keyboard by lying down

So I tried.

# Try

I already have a wireless mouse and wireless keyboard.

For mouse and keyboard operating environment, I bought like this item.

# Result

This is result.

# Pros/Cons

* Pros
  * You can work by lying down.
    * It reduces a fatigue from sitting work.
    * perhaps it is helpful for injured / handicapped person.
* Cons
  * You are required a touch typing skill.
  * Small fonts are still hard to see.
    * You may can solve this issue with control contrust and screen size.
    * may be fall asleep during work.

Pros and cons are depends context of user.

These pros and cons are changed by technical progress. I recommend try it if you interest it.

# Conclusion

"necessity is the mother of invention"

I'm feeling I was pushed by a necessity from these change agent.

* COVID-19 as a force of pursuing remote work.
* Low back pain.
* Death Stranding as a force of building PoC.

I noticed the similarity between the concept of Homo Ludens written by Johan Huizinga And this activity.

> Human culture has emerged and developed as play.

Hideo Kojima, a game designer of Death Stranding also said:

> "Playing" is not simply a pastime, it is the primordial basis of imagination and creation.
> Truth be told, Homo Ludens[Those who Play] are simultaneously Homo Fabel[Those who Create].

Playing has a instability and creativity, If we connect it and activity for creation anything, We may can invent a knowledge we have ever seen.

Recently, I also noticed a fact during my work,

* I can get more effective technical knowledge in spontaneous play and exploration activities than obligatory job.

I recently think it may be effective guideline for knowledge workers in post COVID-19 world.
