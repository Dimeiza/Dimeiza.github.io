      <description>Introduction When I rearranged my room, I suddenly wanted to replace my old NAS.
I have used this.
 It was so useful NAS, But It was a bit large.
So I had tried to replace NAS with NUC, but it wasn’t stable because my NUC had a problem in its power unit.
Then I heard cases that build NAS with Linux single board, so I thought to try it with hobby.</description>

      <description>Today I introduce a bit of pc customize technique with famous mini-ITX case.
I decided to publish this method because I seem this know-how isn’t popular.
Introduction I have a famous mini-ITX case made by In Win. Chopin.
 This is my favolite case.
But my main PC(Ryzen 7 1800X) has been built with DAN cases A4-SFX(It also be awesome case!). Therefore Chopin was used for building a 2nd PC.</description>
